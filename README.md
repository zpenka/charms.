## Games

### Chess

A fully playable chess game in your terminal — two player or vs a computer opponent.

On launch, choose your mode:

- `1` — Two player (pass and play)
- `2` — vs Computer

Then choose your time control:

- `1` — Bullet (1 min per side)
- `2` — Blitz (5 min per side)
- `3` — Rapid (10 min per side)
- `4` — Classical (30 min per side)

When playing vs Computer, you will then choose a difficulty level:

- `1` — Easy (search depth 2 — faster, weaker)
- `2` — Medium (search depth 3 — balanced)
- `3` — Hard (search depth 4 — strongest)

Then choose your colour (`W` for White or `B` for Black).

**Controls:**

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `↑↓←→` / `hjkl` | Move cursor |
| `Enter` / `Space` | Select piece / confirm move |
| `Esc` | Cancel selection |
| `f` | Flip board perspective |
| `?` | Hint (highlight engine's suggested move) |
| `r` | Resign |
| `q` | Quit to lobby |

Valid move destinations are highlighted on the board. After every move, the from- and to-squares are tinted in amber. When the active king is in check, its square is highlighted red. The board auto-flips when you play as Black; press `f` at any time to toggle. Each player's clock counts down on their turn; clocks are displayed below the board. Move history is shown in algebraic notation below the board. The computer opponent uses a minimax engine with alpha-beta pruning, piece-square positional tables, and capture-first move ordering. Search depth is determined by the selected difficulty level (2–4 ply).

**Pawn promotion:** when you move a pawn to the back rank, a picker appears — press `Q`, `R`, `B`, or `N` to choose. The computer always promotes to a queen automatically.
